      <span class="d-block justify-text mt-2">The best renewal private server out there. with good community that help and gives advice to newbies. PVM/PVE is better than i expected. just see it for yourself. :) P.S. the only thing that is hard to enjoy is the PVP i guess? :3. should have added a pvp room with restricted 3rd job skills. i think itll be more enjoyable like that. :)</span>
